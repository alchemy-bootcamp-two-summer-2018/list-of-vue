# List of Vue

Create a vuejs app that displays a list of items and allow user to add new items. You
get to choose your own domain topic, however take a look at requirements to help
guide your choice.

## Components

Basic component structure (use real domain names):

```
App
 |
 +- AddItemForm
 |
 +- ItemList
       |
       +- Item
```

## Items

Pick a domain topic of interest. Limited requirements:

* Has at least three properties
* Conditional rendering based on one of the properties (`v-if`)

## Functionality

1. Create dummy data with at least 3-4 items and return as `data` of `App`
1. Pass callback function to add form, and call when submitted
1. Pass callback function thru list and to item to remove when button clicked
